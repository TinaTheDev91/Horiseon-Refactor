# Horiseon-Refactor
GA Tech BootCamp - Module 01

## Description

This project was completed to refactor the existing code used by Horiseon Marketing. In the process, we added semantic elements to the client's existing HTML code to increase visibility to search engines such as Google. The code was also updated by adding alt text to increase accessibility for those using screen-readers, making for a better user-experience. In addition, the CSS code was also consolidated, making it shorter and easier to read for the next developer. During this process, I have learned how to properly comment, consolidate and increase visibility when creating a public website.
